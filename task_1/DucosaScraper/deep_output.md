>  said **Thomas Drieu, Director of Private Equity at Banque Wormser Frères.**

The project also includes setting up an investor portal to facilitate the tracking of each client’s portfolio and communication with them, as well as producing custom dashboards.
> « We are delighted that Banque Wormser Frères has chosen our solutions to support its growth in unlisted assets. Our expertise in domain ensures the rapid implementation of a digital environment for managing funds and investor relations, which will undoubtedly help Wormser Frères become a leading player in this market. »
